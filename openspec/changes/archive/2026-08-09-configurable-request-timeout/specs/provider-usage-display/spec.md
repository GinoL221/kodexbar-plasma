# Delta for Provider Usage Display

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Validated request timeout

The plasmoid MUST persist integer `requestTimeout` seconds, accepting 30–600, presets 60/120/180, and custom values. Others MUST resolve to 60. It MUST drive the watchdog independently of refresh. Tests MUST precede production changes and pass `./scripts/run-qml-tests.sh`.

#### Scenario: Supported value drives a request
- GIVEN persisted timeout 120
- WHEN a request starts
- THEN its watchdog is 120 seconds

#### Scenario: Custom boundary values
- GIVEN timeout 30 or 600
- WHEN resolved
- THEN that integer becomes active

#### Scenario: Unsupported persistence falls back
- GIVEN timeout is missing, malformed, fractional, or out-of-range
- WHEN resolved
- THEN 60 becomes active

#### Scenario: Strict-TDD suite
- GIVEN implementation ready
- WHEN runner executes
- THEN schema, resolver, wiring, feedback, UI, lifecycle, command, docs, and exclusions pass

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Bounded timeout troubleshooting documentation

The README MUST document bounds, presets, fallback, refresh independence, and retry guidance. The smoke guide MUST cover labeling, keyboard access, wrapping, and Breeze light/dark readability. Neither MUST prescribe exclusions.
(Previously: Fixed 15 seconds.)

#### Scenario: User investigates a timeout
- GIVEN timeout documentation
- WHEN documentation is followed
- THEN timeout differs from refresh and diagnosis stays provider-neutral

### Requirement: Global states and CLI failures

The UI MUST expose Loading, Error, and No data. Timeout MUST show exactly `CodexBar did not return all-provider usage within {seconds} seconds. Check enabled providers in CodexBar, temporarily disable a provider that hangs, then retry.`, using the active integer. Empty stdout MUST show exactly `CodexBar CLI returned no output.` Malformed, timeout, empty, and nonzero outcomes MUST remain distinct; valid unusable output MUST produce No data.
(Previously: Fixed 15-second behavior.)

#### Scenario: Request lifecycle
- GIVEN no newer result
- WHEN loading or failure happens
- THEN Loading or Error remains recoverable

#### Scenario: Watchdog timeout
- GIVEN an unfinished 120-second request
- WHEN 120 seconds elapse
- THEN request releases, exact 120-second Error appears, and snapshot remains

#### Scenario: Empty stdout
- GIVEN empty stdout before timeout
- WHEN handled
- THEN Error shows exactly `CodexBar CLI returned no output.` without timeout text

#### Scenario: Empty response
- GIVEN valid output has no usable data
- WHEN normalized
- THEN surfaces show No data

### Requirement: Refresh and concurrency

Refresh MUST remain independent, default 60, and accept integers 1–3600. Invalid values MUST be rejected. Timeout retry MUST start one generation while retaining snapshots. One request MAY be active; triggers MUST coalesce, and stale responses MUST NOT replace results.
(Previously: Timeout independence was implicit.)

#### Scenario: Invalid interval
- GIVEN invalid refresh
- WHEN saved
- THEN validation blocks and explains correction

#### Scenario: Overlapping triggers
- GIVEN active refresh
- WHEN triggers overlap
- THEN no concurrent request starts and one follow-up MAY run

#### Scenario: Retry after timeout
- GIVEN timeout and snapshot
- WHEN Refresh is activated
- THEN one Loading generation starts, stale completion is ignored, and the snapshot remains

### Requirement: Native and accessible UI

Settings MUST provide a labeled native Plasma/Kirigami/Breeze timeout control for presets and custom integers, distinct from Refresh. It MUST be keyboard-reachable, named, wrapped, and readable in constrained Breeze themes.
(Previously: Configuration accessibility was unspecified.)

#### Scenario: Configure timeout accessibly
- GIVEN keyboard use in Breeze
- WHEN a preset or custom integer is entered
- THEN the labeled control persists it accessibly

### Requirement: MVP exclusions

The plasmoid MUST NOT add attribution, per-provider timeout/isolation, auth/probing, `--web-timeout`, CLI changes, or provider implementation. Refresh MUST issue exactly `usage --provider all --format json --json-only`.
(Previously: New exclusions were implicit.)

#### Scenario: Provider failure guidance
- GIVEN external setup is needed
- WHEN guidance appears
- THEN no auth, probing, or provider action occurs

#### Scenario: Unattributed timeout
- GIVEN timeout lacks identity
- WHEN feedback appears
- THEN no provider is inferred and exact command remains unchanged
